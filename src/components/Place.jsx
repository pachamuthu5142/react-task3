Located at a distance of 180 km from Bangalore, Hogenakkal has water throughout the year. The carbonite rocks, the coracle (basket boat) rides, freshwater fish, oil massages by locals make it a perfect one day trip or a weekend getaway from Bangalore.",

Recently, the place has been found to be littered with plastic bags and garbage and the fish market outside the waterfall might stink. Weekends can be crowded. Keep all these points in mind before visiting.`,
